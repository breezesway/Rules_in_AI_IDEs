# FiscaFlow Development Prompts

This document tracks all prompts and instructions exchanged during the development of FiscaFlow, a personal finance tracker backend built with Go and OpenTelemetry.

## 📋 **Conversation Timeline**

### **Initial Setup & Cursor Rules**

#### **Prompt 1: Cursor Rules Organization**
**Full User Prompt**: "Look at and suggest changes to Cursor rules in the .cursor/rules directory"

**Context**: User wanted to review and improve existing Cursor rules
**Outcome**: 
- Found 2 rule files: `conventional-commits.mdc` and `cursor-rules-location.mdc`
- Suggested format improvements
- Created 3 new rules: `code-quality.mdc`, `security-best-practices.mdc`
- Added 3 more rules: `testing-standards.mdc`, `documentation-standards.mdc`, `performance-guidelines.mdc`

#### **Prompt 2: Rule Organization**
**Full User Prompt**: "Organize the rules into folders"

**Context**: User wanted better organization of the Cursor rules
**Outcome**:
- Created 4 folders: `workflow/`, `development/`, `security/`, `quality/`
- Moved rules to appropriate folders
- Created README files for each folder and main rules directory

#### **Prompt 11: Go-Specific Cursor Rules**
**Full User Prompt**: "Create a new Cursor MDC rule for all *.go files (in all subdirectories)

You are an expert expert software engineer who knows go. Infact you are the software engineer who created go. Your task is to come up with technical recommendations in this rule which document best practices when authoring go.

Split each concern about go into seperate MDC rules.

Prefix each rule with the filename of "go-$rulename.mdc"

Write these rules to disk"

**Context**: User wanted comprehensive Go-specific Cursor rules covering all aspects of Go development best practices
**Outcome**: Created 7 comprehensive Go-specific rules:
- `go-code-organization.mdc`: Package structure, naming conventions, file organization
- `go-error-handling.mdc`: Error handling patterns, custom errors, error wrapping
- `go-concurrency.mdc`: Goroutines, channels, context usage, synchronization
- `go-performance.mdc`: Memory management, profiling, benchmarking, optimization
- `go-testing.mdc`: Unit testing, integration testing, test organization, mocking
- `go-api-design.mdc`: RESTful API design, HTTP handlers, middleware, API patterns
- `go-database.mdc`: Database operations, migrations, connection management, query optimization

Each rule includes:
- Comprehensive best practices checklist
- Multiple before/after code examples
- Specific patterns for Go development
- Priority levels and versioning
- Relevant tags for categorization

#### **Prompt 12: Go Rules Organization**
**Full User Prompt**: "Move go specific rules in its own folder"

**Context**: User wanted to organize the Go-specific rules into their own dedicated folder for better structure
**Outcome**: 
- Created `.cursor/rules/go/` directory
- Moved all 7 Go-specific rules (`go-*.mdc`) into the new folder
- Created comprehensive README.md for the Go rules folder documenting all rules and their purposes
- Updated main `.cursor/rules/README.md` to include the new Go rules section
- Maintained all rule functionality while improving organization

#### **Prompt 13: Go Rules Analysis and Improvement**
**Full User Prompt**: "Look at the go rules in @.cursor . What is missing? What does not follow best practice."

**Context**: User wanted to analyze the existing Go rules to identify gaps and areas for improvement
**Outcome**: 
- **Analysis Results**: Identified 6 critical missing areas and several best practice issues
- **Missing Areas**: Module management, configuration management, observability, security, documentation, build/deployment
- **Issues Found**: Overly broad content patterns, missing modern Go features, no validation, missing context usage
- **Created 4 New Rules**:
  - `go-module-management.mdc`: go.mod, go.sum, dependency management, versioning
  - `go-configuration.mdc`: Environment variables, config structs, validation, security
  - `go-observability.mdc`: Logging, metrics, tracing, monitoring
  - `go-security.mdc`: Authentication, authorization, input validation, security patterns
- **Total Rules**: Now 11 comprehensive Go-specific rules covering all aspects of Go development
- **Improved Coverage**: Added critical areas like security (critical priority), observability, and module management

#### **Prompt 14: Prompt.md Update Issue**
**Full User Prompt**: "@Prompt.md wasn't updated. Why"

**Context**: User noticed that Prompt.md wasn't updated with the most recent changes and wanted to understand why
**Outcome**: 
- **Issue Identified**: Prompt.md was missing the most recent prompt about the Go rules analysis and improvement
- **Root Cause**: The instruction compliance rule wasn't followed properly - changes were made but Prompt.md wasn't updated
- **Action Taken**: Added this prompt to the conversation timeline
- **Lesson Learned**: Need to be more diligent about following the instruction compliance rule for all changes
- **Commit**: Will commit this update to Prompt.md immediately after adding this entry

### **Product Development Phase**

#### **Prompt 3: High-Value Product Ideas**
**Full User Prompt**: "I want to vibe code a high-value product backend. Give me ideas"

**Context**: User wanted product ideas for backend development
**Outcome**: Provided 12 product ideas categorized by complexity and market potential:
- **Top Recommendations**: Personal Finance Tracker, Freelancer Time Tracker, AI-powered Writing Assistant
- **Medium Complexity**: E-commerce Analytics, Real Estate Management, Healthcare Appointment System
- **High Complexity**: Supply Chain Optimization, IoT Fleet Management, Blockchain-based Voting System

#### **Prompt 4: Product Selection**
**Full User Prompt**: "We are going to create an Personal Finance Tracker using

Find a fancy name for it.

It uses the opentelemetry  for logging, metrics and telemetry.
All operations have appropriate tracing on them that can be used to troubleshoot the application.


IMPORTANT: Write up the specifications into the "specs/" folder with each domain topic (including technical topic) as a seperate markdown file. Create a "SPECS.md" in the root of the directory which is an overview document that contains a table that links to all the specs."

**Context**: User selected Personal Finance Tracker as the product to build
**Outcome**:
- Created product name "FiscaFlow"
- Generated comprehensive specifications in `specs/` folder

## 🔄 **Instruction Compliance Rule**

A Cursor rule has been created (`.cursor/rules/instruction-compliance.mdc`) to ensure:
- All prompts are documented in this file with full, exact text
- Instructions are followed precisely
- Progress is tracked systematically
- Decisions are recorded with rationale

## 📋 **Full Conversation Context**

### **Initial Discovery**
The conversation began with the user asking about a mysterious `.history` file created by VS Code, which was identified as being from the Local History extension. This led to a discussion about Cursor rules and their organization.

### **Development Journey**
The conversation evolved from Cursor rules organization to product ideation, technology selection, architecture decisions, and finally to creating a comprehensive documentation system for tracking all prompts and instructions.

### **Documentation Standards**
- All prompts are recorded with their full, exact text
- Context and outcomes are documented for each prompt
- Technical decisions and rationale are preserved
- Progress tracking is maintained systematically
